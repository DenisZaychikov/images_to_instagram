# Space Instagram

These scripts allow you to download space images to your hard drive from http://hubblesite.org/ and https://api.spacexdata.com/, using their API. And then post these images on https://www.instagram.com/. 

### How to install

Python3 should be already installed. 
Then use `pip` (or `pip3`, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes on online-course for web-developers [dvmn.org](https://dvmn.org/).
